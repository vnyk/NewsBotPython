# NewsBotPython
* The news bot is made by using python flask
* I have used inbuilt NLP through wit.ai to extract context and entity values of the message text in the bot.
* For extracting latest news items I have used an open source library gNewsClient, it extracts news items based on the context of user's messages.
* The Flask app runs on heroku cloud.
